# Mean-Average-Precision-for-Object-Detection-COCO-format-Json-
Calculate mean average precision of object detection model manually. Instead of using builtin function of COCO you can use my code for calculating the mAP of an Object detection model. This code calculate mAP using Json files in COCO format
